## functional friday round 1

Haskell is kind of a hard language to learn, because it is different. But, damn, this is exciting! It's like learning that there is a language to express the things that you've been thinking about for quite a while, but haven't quite figured out. I'm using this book, [real world haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/). It seems like multiple haskell students have independently thought of making an ssb client as a learning project, so that's a nice coincidence.

So far have made progress with using JSON, reading cli args, using files, and stdin, stdout. Still need to figure out cli arg parsing — something like minimist but in haskell. 

I have acquired some knowledge about file processing.

```haskell
import Data.Char(toUpper)

-- `gGetContents` is kind of boilerplate-y.
-- So check this out -- our program is a composition of `map toUpper` and
-- `writeFile`
main = do
    inpStr <- readFile "input.txt"
    writeFile "output.txt" (map toUpper inpStr)
```

Haskell does things lazily, so the string, a list of characters, is only read from the file as the characters are processed. It looks like "streaming" is kind of baked in to the compiler — it doesn't buffer the whole file, just as it is processed. `writeFile` is also lazy. Does this mean we have backpressure? I wonder if you can set things like buffer sizes like in node.


## ssb message

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
import GHC.Generics  
import System.Environment  -- getArgs
import Data.Aeson  -- this is for json parsing
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as BS

-- message schema
-- {
--     type: 'post',
--     text: String,
--     channel: optional String,
--     root: optional MsgLink,
--     branch: optional MsgLink,
--     recps: optional FeedLinks,
--     mentions: optional Links
-- }

-- type for posts
data Post = Post {
    text     :: String
  , channel  :: Maybe String
  , root     :: Maybe MsgLink
  , branch   :: Maybe MsgLink
  , recps    :: Maybe [FeedLink]
  , mentions :: Maybe [Link]
} deriving (Generic, Show)

-- forgot how to explain this. We need this to print json
instance ToJSON Post

-- value of type post
post = Post {
    text     = "this is some text"
  , channel  = Nothing
  , root     = Nothing
  , branch   = Nothing
  , recps    = Nothing
  , mentions = Nothing
}

-- type aliases
type MsgLink = String
type FeedLink = String
type Link = String

-- print the json and cli args to stdout
-- @TODO parse cli args
main = do
    BS.putStrLn $ encode post
    mapM_ putStrLn =<< getArgs

-- `=<<` is a neat little thing. I don't know how to articulate what it is,
-- but somehow I knew to put it here. We could also have written this like
-- `args` <- getArgs
-- mapM_ putStrLn args
--
-- `<-` assigns the result of IO, and `=<<` … must return the result of
-- IO to the next function

```

It's pretty fun being a beginner with a language again. You don't quite get the same experience if you were to learn, say Java or Python, because it's basically the same as what you know already.
